			Poem "Hard love"
	
		<p>She cannot stop her waters breaking;<br>
staunch the blood that comes with the birth<br>
of her son, or the flow of milk from her breasts.<br>
She holds him in her arms and feels the spirits<br>
of his fathers hover near, persistent:<br>
He is Adofo*, Adofo. That is his name.<br>
She breathes the baby’s name into his ear,<br>
into his spirit, so he may not forget.
